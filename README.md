# TestTool-Web

WebVR is currently not supported in the stable releases of major browsers.
In order to view this project with the HTC Vive, you need to download a preview version of Chrome, which you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzudLt22BqGRc2lEWDg2NkptNzg). 

But you can open the scene without being able to interact with it, with all major browsers. 

## Build instructions

- open the terminal/command line and go to the project folder
- run `yarn`
- after that run `npm run build`

## Developer instructions
In order access the project scene from the browser you can run `npm run serve` in the terminal and access the site via [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).
